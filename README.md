## Latency_Controller
### Latency controller for distributed machine vision at the Edge
● Investigated the applicability of Approximate Computing by characterizing the impact of image quality on application accuracy for Deep Learning based vision applications.\
● Analysed the impact on detection accuracy and Edge latency after the application of combination of tuning knobs on images exhaustively.\
● Designed a latency controller that uses the Approximate Computing paradigm to simultaneously achieve application specified latency and accuracy in the presence of unpredictable WiFi channel interference.\
● Experimentally demonstrated the operation of the controller on an Edge test bed for two machine vision applications involving object detection (MobileNet), and human pose estimation (OpenPose).\

The project was done as a part of the paper titled: "Latency Control for Distributed Machine Vision at the Edge Through Approximate Computing"\
